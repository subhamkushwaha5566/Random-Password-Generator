# 🔐 Password Generator

A simple yet powerful **React-based Password Generator** that lets you create secure and customizable passwords instantly.  
This project was built by **Shubham Kushwaha** to **understand the core concepts of React**, including hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, and `useRef`.  
🧠 *Note: The main focus of this project is functionality and learning — not advanced UI design.*

## 🧠 Purpose of the Project
This project was created purely for **learning and practice**.  
The goal was to:
- Understand how React state and effects work together  
- Learn how to use `useCallback` and `useRef` effectively  
- Implement clipboard operations in a React environment  
- Build confidence with component structuring and reactivity  

💡 The UI is intentionally minimal — the focus was on logic, not design.  
Future improvements may include a better visual design and theme customization.
